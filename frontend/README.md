This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).


Here, currently we just make a backend call get a random number. 

# In Development

Calls to `/api` are proxied to `http://localhost:3001/` 

We can either have our backend running on `localhost:3001`, or we can use `kubectl` to proxy `localhost:3001` to a live service on a cluster.
